# lheidem.net

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, [lheidem.net](https://lheidem.net).

## Typography

This website uses [Iosveka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka), a monospace font designed for writing code, using in terminals, and preparing technical documents.

The font was chosen for its clean aesthetic that is easy to read and completes the minimalist design of the website.
